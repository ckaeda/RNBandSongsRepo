(No one, no one, no one)\nWho else can heal all our sins and diseases? (No one, no one, no one)\nWho else can walk on the water? (No one, no one, no one)\nAnd who else can answer by fire? (No one, no one, no one)\nAnd who else can bring down the tallest of giants? (No one, no one, no one)\nAnd who else can silence the roar of the lion? (No one, no one, no one)\nWho else is worthy, worthy of worship? (No one, no one, no one)\nWho else is worthy, worthy of worship? (No one)\n\nNo one nowhere, no one nowhere\nNo one nowhere, no one nowhere\nNobody like You, nobody like You\nNo one nowhere, no one nowhere\nNo one nowhere, no one nowhere\nNo one nowhere, no one nowhere\nNobody like You, nobody like You\nNo one nowhere, no one nowhere\nAnd there will be no other god before You\nThere will be no other god before You\nAnd there is no one above You, no one beside You, and nobody like You\nThere is no one above You, no one beside You, and nobody like You\nThere is no one above You, no one beside You, and nobody like You\nAnd there will be no other god before You\nNo one, no one, no one"
