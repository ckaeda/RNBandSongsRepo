[Chorus]
 
C                             G                   Am
Through You I can do anything, I can do all things
                                F
'Cause it's You who gives me strength, nothing is impossible
C                            G                         Am
Through You blind eyes are open, strongholds are broken
                 F
I am living by faith, nothing is impossible
