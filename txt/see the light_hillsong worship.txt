Arise my soul

Remember this

He took my sin
 G
And He buried it
 
[Chorus]
          C D    Em
No longer I who live

Now Jesus lives in me
          C    D  Em
For I was dead in sin

But I woke up
 
To see the light

   G
No I won't boast
   G
But in the cross

That saved my soul

All else is loss
     Em  D  G
The grip of fear
       G
Has no hold on me
   Em    D  G
So where o death
      C  D      G
Where is your sting
 
[Chorus]
          C D    Em
No longer I who live

Now Jesus lives in me
          C    D  Em
For I was dead in sin
           D
But I woke up
 
To see the light
