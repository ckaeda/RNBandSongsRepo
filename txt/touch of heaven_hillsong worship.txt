  Where I'm still in Your presence

  All the noise dies down

  Lord speak to me now

  You have all my attention

  I will linger and listen
G                  Dsus
  I can't miss a thing
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
        G/B     C
Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
   Em
My heart wants something new
   G            D
So I surrender all
 
 
[Chorus]
      C
All I want
                       D
Is to live within Your love
                     Em
Be undone by who You are
                G/B
My desire is to know You deeper
C                     D
Lord, I will open up again
                        Em
Throw my fears into the wind
                     G/B
I am desperate for a touch of heaven

  It's the sweetest of all
