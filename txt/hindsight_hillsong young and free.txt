[Verse 1]
C
  As I reflect
C
  I find perspective
C                                          F
  There in the best and worst days of this life
                      F
You were always on my side
C
  You're in the pain
C
  You're in the promise
C                                       F
  And on the days the furnace finds my faith
                               F
You're the fourth within the flames
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
        Am
I don't need to know what the future says
              Gsus
'Cause if the past could talk it would tell me this
 
 
[Chorus 1]
    F                  C
My God isn't finished yet
       Am                  Gsus
If He did it before He can do it again
          F                        C
So I'll trust Him with what comes next
         Am             Gsus
For the God I know is known for faithfulness
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
F  C    Am                    Gsus
    My hindsight says I can trust Him with what's next
F  C         Am             Gsus                 C
    For the God I know is known for faithfulness
 
 
[Verse 2]
C
  There's more ahead
C
  Than what's behind me
C                                             F
  'Cause through the highs and lows and in between
                    F
God You go ahead of me
C
  Where You call me
C
  I will follow
C                                F
  If the water folds beneath my feet
                              F
Then You'll pull me from the deep
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
        Am
I don't need to know what the future says
              Gsus
'Cause if the past could talk it would tell me this
 
 
[Chorus 1]
    F                  C
My God isn't finished yet
       Am                  Gsus
If He did it before He can do it again
          F                        C
So I'll trust Him with what comes next
         Am             Gsus
For the God I know is known for faithfulness
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
F  C    Am                    G
    My hindsight says I can trust Him with what's next
F  C         Am             G
    For the God I know is known for faithfulness

[Pre-Chorus]
        Gsus                          Am
I don't need to know what the future says
               F
'Cause if the past could talk it would tell me this
 
 
[Chorus 2]
    F                  C
My God isn't finished yet
       Am                  Gsus
If He did it before He can do it again
          F                        C
So I'll trust Him with what comes next
           Am                   Gsus
'Cause my hindsight says I can count on this
 
 
[Chorus 1]
    F                  C
My God isn't finished yet
       Am                  Gsus
If He did it before He can do it again
          F                        C
So I'll trust Him with what comes next
         Am             Gsus
For the God I know is known for faithfulness
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
F  C    Am                    Gsus
    My hindsight says I can trust Him with what's next
F  C         Am             Gsus                C
    For the God I know is known for faithfulness
