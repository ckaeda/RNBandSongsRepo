[Verse 1]
Db
Wandering into the night
Db
Wanting a place to hide
           Gb                Db
This weary soul, this bag of bones
Db
And I tried with all my might
Db
But I just can't win the fight
           Gb           Db
I'm slowly drifting, a vagabond
    Ab                     Bbm
And just when I ran out of road
  Gb                 Db
I met a man I didn't know
    Ab              Bbm         Gb
And He told me that I was not alone
 
[Chorus]
Db
He picked me up
Ebm7
Turned me around
Db/F              Gb
Placed my feet on solid ground
            Bbm
I thank the Master
            Gb
I thank the Savior
Db
Because He healed my heart
Ebm7
He changed my name
   Db/F           Gb
Forever free, I'm not the same
            Bbm
I thank the Master
            Gb
I thank the Savior
        Db
I thank God

[Verse 2]
Db
I cannot dеny what I see
Db
Got no choice but to believе
              Gb
My doubts are burning
                  Db
Like ashes in the wind
Db
So, so long to my old friends
Db
Burden and bitterness
                     Gb
You can just keep it moving
                       Db
Nah, you ain't welcome here
     Ab                             Bbm
From now till I walk the streets of gold
     Gb                       Db
I'll sing of how you saved my soul
     Ab              Bbm                Gb
This wayward son has found his way back home
 
[Chorus]
Db
He picked me up
Ebm7
Turned me around
Db/F              Gb
Placed my feet on solid ground
            Bbm
I thank the Master
            Gb
I thank the Savior
Db
Because He healed my heart
Ebm7
He changed my name
   Db/F           Gb
Forever free, I'm not the same
            Bbm
I thank the Master
            Gb
I thank the Savior
        Db   Dbsus4
