[Verse 1]
                 A               E
I give you my attention, all my focus
                  C#m            B
Pushing off the limits in this moment
                     A               E
I feel Your Spirit moving all around me
                    C#m    B
Come and have Your way
                    A                   E
I'm looking at the dry bones, You're reviving
                      C#m               B
This faith inside of my soul, You're igniting
                        A              E
You're calling me to levels that are higher
                  C#m    B
I can see Your face
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
        A     E     C#m
When I set my eyes on You
 
 
[Chorus]
                     A
Everything else fades
  E               C#m
When I look Your way
   B                 A
Everything else fades
  E               C#m
When I look Your way
  B                  A
Everything else fades
 
 
[Instrumental]
A E C#m B
 
 
[Verse 2]
                    A                  E
To gaze upon Your beauty, full of wonder
                   C#m                    B
The world falling behind me, there's no other
                     A                       E
No other name like Your name, and there's nothing
                   C#m    B
That can take Your place


[Pre-Chorus]
        A     E     C#m
When I set my eyes on You
 
 
[Chorus]
                     A
Everything else fades
  E               C#m
When I look Your way
   B                 A
Everything else fades
  E               C#m
When I look Your way
  B                  A
Everything else fades
