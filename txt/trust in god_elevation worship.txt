[Verse 1]

Blessed assurance
         Am
Jesus is mine
              F
He’s been my fourth man in the fire
C/E        Dm
Time after time
            C
Born of His spirit
              Am
Washed in His blood
             F
And what He did for me on Calvary
C/E           Dm
Is more than enough

All is at rest
           F
I know the Author of tomorrow
C/E            Dm
Has ordered my steps
                C
So this is my story
               Am
And this is my song
            F
Praising my risen King and Savior
C/E      Dm     F
All the day long
 
[Chorus]

He will never fail

He will never fail
