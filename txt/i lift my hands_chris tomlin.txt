[Verse 1]
      G               C2
Be still, there is a healer
     Em                     D
His love is deeper than the sea
    G         C2
His mercy is unfailing
    Em                       D
His arms, a fortress for the weak
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           Am    C
Let Faith Arise
           Em   D
Let Faith Arise
 
 
[Chorus]
          G
I Lift My Hands to believe again
           Em                    C2
You are my Refuge, you are my strength
                  G
As I Pour out my heart, these things I remember
         Dm7            C
You are Faithful God forever
 
 
[Verse 2]
    G                 C2
Be Still, there is a river
      Em                   D
That flows from Calvary's Tree
     G               C2
A Fountain for the thirsty
     Em                     D
His Grace, that washes over me
 
 
[Bridge]
           G                C2     
Let Faith Arise, Let Faith Arise
         Em            D
Open My Eyes, Open My Eyes
