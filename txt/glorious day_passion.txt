[Verse 1]
      D                                  Bm
I was buried beneath my shame who could carry that kind of weight
           G              D
It was my tomb 'til I met You
 
[Verse 2]
      D                              Bm
I was breathing but not alive all my failures I tried to hide
           G              D
It was my tomb 'til I met You
 
[Chorus]
              G                           Dsus  D  Dsus  D
You called my name, and I ran out of that grave
            G                             Dsus  D  Dsus  D
Out of the darkness, into Your glorious day

You called my name, and I ran out of that grave

Out of the darkness, into Your glorious day
 
[Verse 3]
         D                                Bm
Now Your mercy has saved my soul now Your freedom is all that I know
             G                       D
The old made new, Jesus, when I met You Oh what a day
 
[Chorus]
                    G                          Dsus  D  Dsus  D
When You called my name, and I ran out of that grave
            G                            Dsus  D  Dsus  D
Out of the darkness, into Your glorious day
               G                          Bm
You called my name, and I ran out of that grave
            G                            Dsus  D  Dsus  D
Out of the darkness, into Your glorious day

[Bridge]
D
I needed rescue my sin was heavy, but chains break at the weight of Your glory
D
I needed shelter I was an orphan now You call me a citizen of Heaven

When I was broken You were my healing now Your love is the air that I'm breathing
Bm              A                                       G
I have a future my eyes are open oh when You called my name

I ran out of that grave!
