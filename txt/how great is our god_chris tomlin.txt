 G                       Em7
The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty,
                    C2
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.

He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
                     C2
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.

Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
                    C2
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
 G                         Em7
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
                     C2
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.
