[Verse]
  G          Em        C   G     D
This is my desire to honour You
 Em               G               F   C   D
Lord with all my heart I worship You
G             Em
All I have within me
  C   G           D
I give You praise
    Em          G           F   C   D
And all that I adore is in You
 
[Chorus]
G                    D
Lord I give You my heart
               Am
I give You my soul
   C        D    G
I live for You alone
G                    D
Every breath that I take
                  Am
Every moment I'm awake
      C         D         G   D
Lord have Your way in me
