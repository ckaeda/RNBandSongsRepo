[Intro]
B      G#m    F#      E     
 
 
[Verse 1]
       B
All my words fall short
      G#m
I got nothing new
          F#
How could I express
      E
All my gratitude
 
 
[Verse 2]

       E
And You never do
 
 
[Chorus]
     B

                          F#
And praise You again and again
       F#
'Cause all that I have is a
E           G#m  F#
Hallelujah, hallelujah
      B
And I know it's not much
                                F#
But I've nothing else fit for a King
     F#
Except for a heart singing
E           G#m  F#   B
Hallelujah, hallelu - jah
 
 
[Verse 3]
         B
I've got one response
         G#m
I've got just one move
        F#
With my arms stretched wide
      E
I will worship You
 
 
[Chorus]
     B
So I throw up my hands
                          F#
And praise You again and again
     F#
'Cause all that I have is a
E           G#m  F#
Hallelujah, hallelujah
      B
And I know it's not much
                                F#
But I've nothing else fit for a King
     F#
Except for a heart singing
E           G#m  F#   B
Hallelujah, hallelu - jah
