With my arms stretched wide
      E
I will worship You
 
 
[Chorus]
     B
So I throw up my hands
                          F#
And praise You again and again
     F#
'Cause all that I have is a
E           G#m  F#
Hallelujah, hallelujah
      B
And I know it's not much

     F#
Except for a heart singing
E           G#m  F#   B
Hallelujah, hallelu - jah
