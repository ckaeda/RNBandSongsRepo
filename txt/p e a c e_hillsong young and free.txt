[Verse 1]
 
Bm
You will stay true
A             G
Even when the lies come
     Bm
Your Word remains truth
A            G
Even when my thoughts don't line up
D/F#         Em
I will stand tall
        D/F#        G
On each promise You made
         A
Let the rest fade away
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G            D/F#       Bm             A
  There's a peace far beyond all understanding
G        D/F#     Bm            A
  May it ever set my heart at ease
G        D     Bm           A
  Dare anxiety come, I'll remember
     G            A          Bm
That peace is a promise You keep
G            A          D
Peace is a promise You keep
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Bm
You will stay true
A           G
Even in the chaos
     Bm
Your Word remains truth
A            G
Even when my mind wreaks havoc
D/F#      Em
I will be still
         D/F#       G
For I've known all along
      A
My Jehovah Shalom
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G            D/F#       Bm             A

  May it ever set my heart at ease
G        D     Bm         A
  What anxiety fails to remember
   G           A           Bm
Is peace is a promise You keep
G           A           Bm
Peace is a promise You keep

        G            D/F#       Bm   A
You are peace to a restless soul
G                 D/F#         Bm   A
Peace when my thoughts wage war
G             D          Bm
Peace to the anxious heart
A                G  A              Bm
That's who You are, that's who You are
        G              D/F#         Bm   A
You are peace when my fear takes hold
G             D/F#     Bm   A
Peace when I feel enclosed
G             D/F#     Bm
Peace when I lose control
A                G  A              Bm
That's who You are, that's who You are
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G            D           Bm            A
  I've found peace far beyond all understanding
G        D            Bm             A
  Let it flow when my mind's under siege
G       D     Bm          A
  All anxiety bows in the presence
   G           A        Bm
Of Jesus the Keeper of Peace
    G            A          D
And peace is a promise He keeps
