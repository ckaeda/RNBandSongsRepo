[Verse 1]
        D
Are you past the point of weary?
        Bm7
Is your burden weighing heavy?
      A
Is it all too much to carry?
G2
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus
       D
Do you feel that empty feeling?
       Bm7
'Cause shame's done all its stealing
           A
And you're desp'rate for some healing
G2
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus
 
 
[Chorus]
   D
He makes a way where there ain't no way
Bm7
Rises up from an empty grave
A
Ain't no sinner that He can't save
G2
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus
    D
His love is strong and His grace is free
        Bm7
And the good news is I know that He
    A
Can do for you what He's done for me
G2
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus
    G2
And let my Jesus change your life

[Verse 2]
        D
Who can wipe away the tears
            Bm7
From broken dreams and wasted years
             A
And tell the past to disappear? Oh
G2
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus
            D
And all the wrong turns that you would
       Bm7
Go and undo if you could
        A
Who can work it all for your good
G2
Let me tell you about my Jesus
 
 
[Chorus]
   D
He makes a way where there ain't no way

Rises up from an empty grave
A
Ain't no sinner that He can't save

His love is strong and His grace is free
        Bm7
And the good news is I know that He
    A
Can do for you what He's done for me

And let my Jesus change your life

[Verse 3]
          D
Who would take my cross to Calvary?
        Bm7
Pay the price for all my guilty?
          A                        D/F#
Who would care that much about me?
G2                               Gm6
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus, oh
 
 
[Chorus]
       
He makes a way where there ain't no way
    
Rises up from an empty grave
    
Ain't no sinner that He can't save
                 G2
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus
    D
His love is strong and His grace is free
        Bm7
And the good news is I know that He
    A
Can do for you what He's done for me
G2
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus
