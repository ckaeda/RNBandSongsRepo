[Verse 1]
D                                         G2
When all I see is the battle, you see my victory
Bm7                                 Asus        G2
When all I see is the mountain, you see a mountain moved
D                                               G2
And as I walk through the shadows, your love surrounds me
Bm7                                Asus    D
There's nothing to fear now, for I am safe  with you
 
 
[Chorus]
           G2          D           A              Bm7          G2
So when I fight, I’ll fight on my knees, with my hands lifted high
    D                 A        Bm7
Oh God, the battle belongs to you
       G2     D           A          Bm7              G
Every fear I lay at your feet, I’ll sing through the night
    D               A         D
Oh God, the battle belongs to you
 
 
[Verse 2]
D                                   G2
And if you are for me, who can be against me
Bm7                         Asus    G2
For Jesus there’s nothing impossible for you
D                                           G2
When all I see are the ashes, you see the beauty
Bm7                                 Asus       D
When all I see is a cross, God you see the empty tomb
 
 
[Chorus]
           G2          D           A              Bm7          G2
So when I fight, I’ll fight on my knees, with my hands lifted high
    D                 A        Bm7
Oh God, the battle belongs to you
           G2     D           A          Bm7              G
And Every fear I lay at your feet, I’ll sing through the night
    D               A         D
Oh God, the battle belongs to you
