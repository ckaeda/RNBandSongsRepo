[Verse 1]
E
You were a lover before time’s beginning
C#m                                               A         B
You gave Your love freely, withholding nothing, Jesus, my Jesus
      E
You carried the weight of the world on Your shoulders
C#m                                                A          B
You stopped at nothing, to prove You were for us, Jesus, my Jesus
 
[Chorus]
E               B                  C#m                   A
It’s extravagant, it doesn’t make sense, we’ll never comprehend
                 E
The way you love us
                B              C#m                      A
It’s unthinkable, only heaven knows, just how far You’d go
                E
To say You love us
 
[Verse 2]
E
You don’t belittle our pain and our suffering
C#m                                         A          B
You comfort us in our greatest unraveling, Jesus, my Jesus
E
You are the dawn that is breaking within me
C#m                                         A         B
You are the sun that is rising around me, Jesus, my Jesus
 
[Chorus]
E               B                  C#m                   A
It’s extravagant, it doesn’t make sense, we’ll never comprehend
                 E
The way you love us
                B              C#m                      A
It’s unthinkable, only heaven knows, just how far You’d go
                E
To say You love us
 
[Bridge]
A        E      B                 C#m    B
Here is all my love, it’s Your’s, no conditions 
A          E       B           C#m    B
When You pull me close, no, I won’t resist it
 
[Chorus]
E               B                  C#m                   A
It’s extravagant, it doesn’t make sense, we’ll never comprehend
                 E
The way you love us
                B              C#m                      A
It’s unthinkable, only heaven knows, just how far You’d go
                E
To say You love us
