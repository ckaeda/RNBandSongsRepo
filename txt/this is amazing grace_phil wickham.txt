C
  Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
F
  Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
Am                  G                          Fmaj7
  The King of Glory,  the King above all kings
C
  Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
F
  Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
Am                  G                          Fmaj7
  The King of Glory,  the King above all kings

This is unfailing love
                         Am
That You would take my place
                         G
That You would bear my cross
                    C
You laid down Your life
                      F
That I would be set free
Am
   Jesus, I sing for
G
   All that You've done for me
