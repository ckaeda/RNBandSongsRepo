[Verse 1]
F
  I close my eyes and colours fly
Am           G                F
  There's no hiding from Your grace
             F
I can't deny Your heart for mine
Am        G           F
  And its unrelenting chase
             F
I was on the edge of deception
Am                G
  Caught up in my own hesitation
Dm           C/E            F   G
  Until Your love took over me
 
 
[Chorus]
     Dm           F
So I let go and I let love
        Am                         G
Show me life like it's supposed to be
    Dm         F
An oasis here awaits us
        Am                G
All the freedom I'll ever need
             Dm
Now I'm alive
          F
Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
     Am       G
When I let go then I found life
Dm        F
Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
     Am                    Dm
When I let go then I found life

[Verse 2]
F
  The higher way is calling me
Am     G             F
  To a life unlike before
                 F
The Father's heart is beckoning
Am      G
  And I can't resist no more
F
  Lead me in the ways of devotion
Am                    G
  I don't want to get caught in the motions
Dm            C/E           F    G
  My heart is only for You, Lord
 
 
[Chorus]
     Dm           F
So I let go and I let love
        Am                         G
Show me life like it's supposed to be
    Dm         F
An oasis here awaits us
        Am                G
All the freedom I'll ever need

Now I'm alive

Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
     Am       G
When I let go then I found life
Dm        F
Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
     Am                    Dm
When I let go then I found life
