Em7 G Em7 G
 
 
[Verse 1]
      Em7                 G
And I close my eyes to see
   Em7            G
My king in majesty
     Am7                  C
Your grace compels my soul
   Am7                C
To love and draw in close
 
 
[Verse 2]
      Em7                   G
And I lift my hands and sing
   Em7              G
Surrender everything
   Am7              C
In You I know I'm found
   Am7                C
My God to You I'll bow
 
 
[Chorus]
             Em               C
Now until forever, Jesus I surrender
               G                      D
Show me what I don't know, more of You
                       Em                      C
I'm desperate for Your presence, longing to be with You
             G                     D
Lead me to a new place, more of You
 
 
[Verse 3]
            Em7             G
Through the fire I'll persevere
           Em7            G
I won't submit to any fear
        Am7                   C
Where I go, You've been before
           Am7             C
And all my trust is in You Lord
 
 
[Chorus]
             Em7               C
Now until forever, Jesus I surrender
               G                    D
Show me what I don't know, more of You
                       Em7                     C
I'm desperate for Your presence, longing to be with You
             G                  D
Lead me to a new place, more of You
 
             Em7               C
Now until forever, Jesus I surrender
               G                    D
Show me what I don't know, more of You
                       Em7                     C
I'm desperate for Your presence, longing to be with You
             G                  D
Lead me to a new place, more of You
