[Verse]
         D                   G
I was lost with a broken heart
         D                     A
You picked me up, now I'm set apart
              D            G
From the ash I am born again
             D                 A
Forever safe in the Saviour's hands
             D                     G
You are more than my words could say
              D                  A
I'll follow you Lord for all my days
               D                    G
I'll fix my eyes, follow in your ways
             D             A
Forever free in unending grace
 
 
[Chorus]
       D                             G
'Cause You are, You are, You are my freedom

We lift you higher, lift you higher
 D                                    G
Your love, Your love, Your love never ending
Bm     A
Oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
           D                    G
In the midst of the darkest night
             D                A
Let Your love be the shining light
              D                    G
Breaking chains that were holding me
              D                    A
You sent Your Son down and set me free
      D                        G
Everything in this world will fade
             D                   A
I'm pressing on till I see your face
        D                       G
I will live that Your will be done
        D                       A
I won't stop till Your Kingdom come
