[Verse 1]
G
 I've tried so hard to see it
Em
 Took me so long to believe it
G/D
 That You'd choose someone like me
C
 To carry Your victory

G
 Perfection could never earn it
Em
 You give what we don't deserve and
G/D
 You take the broken things
C
 And raise them to glory

 You are my champion
Em                    G/B

 Undefeated every battle you've won
G                   D
 I am who you say I am

 Now I can finally see it

 You're teaching me how to receive it

 So let all the striving cease
C
 This is my victory
