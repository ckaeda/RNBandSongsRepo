[Verse 1]
 
Em    C2
Love unfailing
G      D           Em C2
Overtaking my heart
G           D
You take me in
Em           C2
Finding peace again

Fear is lost in all you are
 
[Pre-Chorus]

And I would give the world
                Em
To tell your story
                                 C2
'Cause I know that you've called me
                            G
I know that you've called me
 
D
I've lost myself for good
               C2
Within your promise
                 Em
And I won't hide it
             C2
I won't hide it
 
[Chorus]
 
G
Jesus I believe in You
    D
And I would go
       Am7
To the ends of the earth
       C2
To the ends of the earth
        G
For you alone are the Son of God
    F2
And all the world will see
               Am7
That you are God
             C2
That you are God
