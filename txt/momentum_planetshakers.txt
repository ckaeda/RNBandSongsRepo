[Verse 1]
G              C       Em            D
I can see it coming, a wave of His power
G                    C            Em          D
You won’t find me running, ‘cause this is the hour
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Em              C
That I am going deeper
   D                      Am
To places that I’ve never been
Em            C
I believe for greater
   D                          Am
To see things that I’ve never seen

Em         G              D               Am
Our God is moving and His love is unstoppable
Em                G             D
So keep the party going, no stopping

Caught up in momentum
Em                  G                 D             Am
We lift Him higher,(lift Him) higher,(lift Him) higher
Em                 G                D            Am
We sing it louder,(sing it) louder,(sing it) louder
 
 
[Verse 2]
G               C        Em             D
I can feel it rising, a flood of His glory
G               C            Em             D
His love is overwhelming and I know it's drawing

To see things that I’ve never seen

We lift Him higher,(lift Him) higher,(lift Him) higher
Em                  G                D            Am
We sing it louder,(sing it) louder,(sing it) louder
