[Intro]
 
Asus   Bm   G   D
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Asus
  When night has fallen
Bm
  When fear is common
G                     D
  Still You're calling me
Asus
  When faith is lost
   Bm
And my hope exhausted
G               D
  You will be my strength
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
        Asus              Bm
When my mind says I'm not good enough
     G                  D
God, You're enough for me
       Asus          Bm
I've decided I'm not giving up
            G
'Cause You won't give up on me
     G
You won't give up on me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
      Asus
Your love is holding on
              Bm
And it won't let go
   G                           D
I feel it breaking out like an echo
      Asus
Your love is holding on
              Bm
And it won't let go
   G                           D
I feel it breaking out like an echo
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
 
           Bm       G
Echo in my so-o-o-o-oul
G        D
So-o-o-o-oul
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Asus
  In every season
Bm                  G           D
  You keep repeating promises to me
Asus
  Now there's no stopping
Bm
  What you have started
G                 D
  Until it is com - plete
