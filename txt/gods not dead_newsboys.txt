[Intro]
 
Em  D  G
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Em           D                   G
  Let love explode and bring the dead to life
Am          Em                C
  A love so bold to see a revolution somehow
 

[Pre-Chorus]
 
D                     Em
  Now I'm lost in Your freedom
D                     Em  C
  And this world I'll overcome
 
 
[Chorus]
 
   D
My God's not dead, He's surely alive
      Em
He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
D
God's not dead, He's surely alive
      Em                  C
He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
      Em            D
He's roaring, He's roaring
      G
He's roaring like a lion!
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G
  Let hope arise and make the darkness hide
Am            G                  C
  My faith is dead I need a resurrection somehow
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
D                     Em
  Now I'm lost in Your freedom
D                     Em  C
  And this world I'll overcome
 
 
[Chorus]
 
   D
My God's not dead, He's surely alive
      Em
He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
D
God's not dead, He's surely alive
      Em                  C
He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
      Em            D
He's roaring, He's roaring
      G
He's roaring like a lion!
      Em            D
He's roaring, He's roaring
 
 
[Bridge]
 
          G             D
Let heaven roar and fire fall
               Em                         C
Come shake the ground with the sound of revival
           G             D
Let heaven roar and fire fall
               Em                         C
Come shake the ground with the sound of revival
           G             D
Let heaven roar and fire fall
               Em                         C
Come shake the ground with the sound of revival
 
 
[Chorus]
 
   D
My God's not dead, He's surely alive
      Em
He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
D
God's not dead, He's surely alive
      Em
He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
   D
My God's not dead, He's surely alive
      Em
He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
D
God's not dead, He's surely alive
      Em                  C
He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
      Em            D
He's roaring, He's roaring
