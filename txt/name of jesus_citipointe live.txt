[Intro]
C  F  Am  F

[Verse]
     C                  F
Your Name, is above all Names
                      Am                       F
Glorious you are this day, forever Your love remains
     C                           F
Your hands have already made the way
                      Am                       F
For multitudes to be saved, Lord we cry out in praise
    Am                    C                    F                     G
For You, are the Lord of all, You pierce every soul, with your love alone

         C            G
There is power in the name
        Am             F       C   F   G
Thereâ€™s healing in the name of Jesus, Jesus

Am     F      C      G
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
