[Verse 1]
C                     Csus
When did I start to forget
C                           Csus
All of the great things You did
Am          G          F               C        Csus
When did I throw away faith for the impossible?
C                    Csus
How did I start to believe
C                         Csus
You weren’t sufficient for me
Am       G           F             C        Bb/D
Why do I talk myself out of seeing miracles?

And I’ve got my confidence back
Am       G            F                  C
