[Intro]
G   C
 
[Verse 1]
G                                         C
Just one word You calm the storm that surrounds me
G                                     C
Just one word the darkness has to retreat
G                                      C
Just one touch I feel the presence of heaven
Em             D
Just one touch   my eyes were opened to see
C
My heart can't help but believe
 
[Chorus 1]
                         G
There's nothing that our God can't do
                            C
There's not a mountain that He can't move
              Em                D
Oh praise the Name that makes a way
                         C
There's nothing that our God can't do
 
[Verse 2]
G                                        C
Just one word You heal what's broken inside me
G                                  C
Just one word and You revive every dream
G                                   C
Just one touch I feel the power of heaven
Em             D
Just one touch   my eyes were opened to see
C
My heart can't help but believe
 
 
[Chorus 1]
                         G
There's nothing that our God can't do
                            C
There's not a mountain that He can't move
              Em                D
Oh praise the Name that makes a way
                         C
There's nothing that our God can't do
 
 
[Chorus 2]
                         G
There's nothing that our God can't do
                             C
There's not a prison wall He can't break through
              Em                D
Oh praise the Name that makes a way
                         C
There's nothing that our God can't do
