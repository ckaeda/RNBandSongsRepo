[Verse 1]
         C
I cast my mind to Calvary
            G             Am
Where Jesus bled and died for me
          F                    C/E
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
          G           C        C/E  F
My Saviour on that cursed tree
 
 
[Verse 2]
         C
His body bound and drenched in tears
              G              Am
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
             F             C/E
The entrance sealed by heavy stone
       G               C     C/E  F
Messiah still and all alone
 
 
[Chorus]
  C                      F        C
O praise the Name of the Lord our God
  Am                 G
O praise His Name forevermore
    C/E                   F         Am
For endless days, we will sing Your praise
   F        G        C      C/E   F
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
 
 
[Verse 3]
           C
Then on the third, at break of dawn
           G          Am
The Son of heaven rose again
           F                 C/E
O trampled death, where is your sting
          G                   C
The angels roar for Christ the King
 
 
[Verse 4]
           C
He shall return in robes of white
            G                 Am
The blazing sun shall pierce the night
           F            C/E
And I will rise among the saints
           G                C
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face
