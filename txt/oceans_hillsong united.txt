[Verse 1]
Bm              A/C#       D            
You call me out upon the waters
           A                       G
The great unknown where feet may fail
Bm                  A/C#     D         
And there I find You in the mystery
            A                    G
In oceans deep   My faith will stand
 
 
[Chorus]
G           D              A
And I will call upon Your name
G            D             A
And keep my eyes above the waves
             G
When oceans rise    
              D              A
My soul will rest in your embrace
           G         A      Bm
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
                A                G
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Bm                      A/C#      D         
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
              A                       G
You've never failed and you won't start now
 
[Chorus]
G           D              A
And I will call upon Your name
G            D             A
And keep my eyes above the waves
             G
When oceans rise    
              D              A
My soul will rest in your embrace
           G         A      Bm
For I am Yours and You are mine
