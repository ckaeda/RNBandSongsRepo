[Chorus]
           D     Em7
I need you more, more than yesterday
           A     G                   D
I need you more, more than words can say.
           Bm         G D/F#  Em
I need you more, than ever  before
            D   A             D

              G                            A       Bm
More than the air I breathe, more than the song I sing
              G               Em7/D        D
More than the next heartbeat, more than anything.
             G                     A       Bm
And Lord, as time goes by, I'll be by your side
        Em7           D/F#       Asus4  A
cause I never want to go back to my old life.
