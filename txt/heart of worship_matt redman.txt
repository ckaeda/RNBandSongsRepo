[Verse 1]
G               D                         Am7               D
When the music fades, and all is stripped away, and I simply come
 G                D                       Am7
Longing just to bring something that's of worth that'll bless Your
  D
heart
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 Am7           G           D                         Am7
I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself
              G        D         Am7
It's not what You have required
                G      D                                     Am7
You search much deeper within, through the ways things appear
               G       D
You're looking into my heart
 
[Chorus]
 G                       D
I'm coming back to the Heart of worship
         Am                  C         D         G
And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus
                         D
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made of it
          Am                  C         D         G    Gsus   G
When it's all about You, it's all about You Jesus
 
[Verse 2]
                 D                   Am7                         D     Dsus    G
King of endless worth, no one could express, just how much You deserve
                    D                   Am7                  D      Dsus
Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours, every single breath
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 Am7           G           D                         Am7
I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself
              G        D         Am7
It's not what You have required
                G      D                                     Am7
You search much deeper within, through the ways things appear
               G       D
You're looking into my heart
 
[Chorus]
 G                       D
I'm coming back to the Heart of worship
         Am                  C         D         G
And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus
                         D
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made of it
          Am                  C         D         G    Gsus   G
When it's all about You, it's all about You Jesus
 
[Bridge]
                         D
coming back to the heart
                         Am
coming back to the heart
                         C         D          G
it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus
