[Verse 1]
C#m                 F#m
Left my fear by the side of the road 
A               B
Hear You speak, won't let go 
C#m                     E               Bsus  B
Fall to my knees, as I lift my hands to pray 
C#m                    F#m
Got every reason to be here again 
A                   B
Father's love that draws me in 
    C#m               E                   Bsus  B
And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You 
 
 
[Chorus]
               F#m
All I need is You 
A             E               B
All I need is You, Lord, is You, Lord 
              F#m
All I need is You 
A             E               B
All I need is You, Lord, is You, Lord 
 
 
[Verse 2]
C#m                    F#m
One more day, and it's not the same 
     A                B
Your Spirit calls my heart to sing 
C#m                       E           Bsus  B
Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again 
C#m                        F#m
Where would my soul be without Your Son 
A                 B
Gave His life to save the earth 
C#m                             E             Bsus B
Rest in the thought that You're watching over me

      F#m      A
All I need is You 
      E        B
All I need is You 
      F#m      A
All I need is You 
       E       B
All I need is You
