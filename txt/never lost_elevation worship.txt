Miracles when You move
F#/A#
Such an easy thing for You to do
G#m7         E
Your hand is moving right now

You are still showing up
F#/A#
At the tomb of every Lazarus
G#m7          E
Your voice is calling me out
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C#m7  B/D#  E
Right now,  I know You're able

And my   God, come through again

You can do all things
G#m7       F#m7 B          E
You can do all  things but fail
              E
'Cause You've never lost a battle

Everything's possible
F#/A#
By the power of the Holy Ghost

A new wind is blowing right now

Breaking my heart of stone

Taking over like it's Jericho
G#m7             E
And my walls are all crashing down
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    C#m7  B/D# E
But right now, I know You're able
